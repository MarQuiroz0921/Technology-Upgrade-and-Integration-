# Technology-Upgrade-and-Integration-
participated in a work project that involved replacing all existing computers with new ones, as well as upgrading an outdated Honeywell printer to newer models. Additionally, I needed to integrate these new devices into our network by configuring our DHCP server to assign IP addresses based on their MAC addresses

Inventory and Assessment:
Assessed the current inventory of computers and printers to determine the specifications needed for replacements.
Evaluated the compatibility and requirements for the new devices.


Procurement and Deployment:
Procured the new computers and Honeywell printers according to the established specifications.
Deployed the new devices in the workplace, replacing the old ones.

Configuration of New Devices:
Set up the new computers with the required operating system and software.
Configured settings and applications to meet the needs of users.

Installation of New Printers:
Installed the new Honeywell printers in designated areas.
Ensured proper connectivity to the network, either via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

Integration with DHCP Server:
Accessed the DHCP server's configuration interface.
Added the MAC addresses of the new devices and mapped them to the IP addresses previously assigned to the old ones.
Implemented static IP addresses or reserved DHCP leases for consistency.

Testing and Validation:
Conducted thorough testing to ensure connectivity and functionality of the new devices.
Verified that the DHCP server correctly assigned IP addresses to the new devices.

User Migration and Training:
Facilitated the transition of users to the new computers and printers.
Provided training and support to ensure a smooth adjustment to the new devices.

Documentation and Maintenance:
Updated documentation and user guides to reflect the changes.
Established procedures for ongoing maintenance, including software updates and troubleshooting.
